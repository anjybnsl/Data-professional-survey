I explored the fascinating world of data professionals through a recent project - the Data Professional Survey Breakdown.

This project involved a deep dive into a survey conducted by Alex Freberg (Alex The Analyst) using his "Data Analyst Bootcamp." I transformed raw data from Excel into a captivating Power BI dashboard, cleaning it up and uncovering hidden insights.

**Tools used** - Power BI, Excel learnings

Get ready to be amazed by the power of data visualization! The interactive dashboard allows you to explore connections between attributes, identify trends, and witness the magic of data storytelling.


**Key Insights:**
